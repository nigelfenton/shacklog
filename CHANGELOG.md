# Changelog

All notable changes to ShackLog are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project uses
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Releases are cut by pushing a
`vX.Y.Z` tag; CI then builds the Windows installer + zip, Linux AppImage, and
macOS DMG and attaches them to the GitHub release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **APRS Activity window** (Tools → APRS Activity) — connects to AetherSDR's
  KISS-over-TCP TNC (default `127.0.0.1:8001`), decodes the off-air AX.25/APRS
  traffic, and shows a live roster of heard stations with great-circle
  distance/bearing from `MY_GRIDSQUARE`, time-since-heard, APRS symbol, and a ✓
  against any call already in the log. Stale stations age out (default 1 h).
  A message row sends APRS text back out through AetherSDR. The decoder
  (`AprsDecode`) is a clean-room KISS/AX.25/APRS implementation with 23 unit
  tests (build with `-DSHACKLOG_TESTS=ON`); the socket client
  (`AprsKissClient`) auto-reconnects like the TCI client.
- **Server: live ARRL Field Day score** — `GET /api/score` returns a JSON
  breakdown (QSO points × power multiplier + bonus), classifying phone/CW/
  digital per FD rules; power multiplier and bonus are query params.
- **Server: N3FJP network mirror** — `N3fjpClient` connects to a remote N3FJP
  server and logs its QSOs into the local database.

### Changed
- **Unified ADIF parsing.** The server's WSJT-X UDP receiver used its own copy
  of the ADIF field parser; it now uses the shared `AdifReader` (same parser as
  File → Import ADIF). As a side benefit, WSJT-X ingest now gets band-from-freq
  derivation, the MODE:USB/LSB → SSB+SUBMODE fold, and QSL/LoTW/eQSL field
  handling it previously lacked. Verified end-to-end with a live FT8 datagram.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- **Section map** (Maps menu) — a native, N3FJP-style ARRL/RAC section map.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- Callsign-lookup XML parsing: QRZ/HamQTH responses were consumed whole by
  `readElementText()` on a container element, so the session id never parsed
  and login always "failed". Replaced with a leaf-text token walk.
- DX cluster duplicate-login ping-pong: two clients on one call-SSID kicked
  each other in a ~1 s reconnect storm. Reconnect backoff now only resets
  after sustained uptime, kicks are detected and surfaced to the operator,
  and a kicked client backs off to 30 s.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- **Callsign lookup chain** — three-tier autofill of empty QSO fields at save:
  worked-before → offline cty.dat prefix resolver → online (QRZ / HamQTH /
  callook.info). Bundled `cty.dat` as a Qt resource; new Settings → Lookup tab.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-10

### Added
- **ADIF file import** (File → Import ADIF) — whole-file, single-transaction,
  deduplicated import via a shared byte-oriented ADIF reader. Proven on a real
  16k+ record HRD export.
- **Multi-operator logs** — one SQLite database per callsign, with a startup
  operator chooser and live *Switch Operator/Log*.
- **Awards panel** (Tools → Awards) — DXCC / WAS / WAC / WAZ / grids, worked vs
  confirmed, with chase lists.
- **"How far?"** button — opens a PSK Reporter map filtered to your callsign
  and current band.
- **Desktop WSJT-X ingest** — logs WSJT-X "Secondary UDP" QSOs straight into
  the open log (solo-operating mode).
- **Server (Field Day infrastructure)** — headless companion exposing an HTTP
  API (`/api/qsos`) and an N3FJP-compatible TCP endpoint, writing into the
  shared logbook with schema versioning, an audit trail, and soft-delete;
  ingests WSJT-X Secondary-UDP spots.

### Changed
- Cross-platform verified on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Build fixed on Qt 6.4
  (`QWebSocket::errorOccurred` is Qt 6.5+).

## [0.1.2] — 2026-05-08

### Added
- Initial release: SQLite-backed logbook, TCI WebSocket auto-fill of freq /
  band / mode, quick QSO entry with live duplicate check, filterable QSO
  table, full-fidelity QSO editor, ADIF 3.1.4 and Cabrillo 3.0 export, and a
  cross-platform GitHub Actions release workflow.
